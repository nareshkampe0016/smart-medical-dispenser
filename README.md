# Smart-Medical-Dispenser
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, medication adherence has become a significant challenge, particularly among the elderly and individuals with chronic illnesses. Patients often forget to take their medications on time or may take incorrect dosages, leading to serious health complications, hospitalizations, or ineffective treatment outcomes.

To address this critical issue, our project proposes the design and development of a Smart Medicine Pill Dispenser. This system automates medicine reminders, ensures the correct dosage is dispensed at the right time, and minimizes the possibility of human error. The dispenser will be equipped with features such as:

-> Automated scheduling and alerts for medication intake

-> Visual and audio reminders

-> Accurate dispensing of prescribed pills

-> Real-time monitoring and notifications for missed doses

-> Integration with mobile apps or IoT platforms for remote supervision

-> By combining technology with healthcare needs, this project aims to improve medication adherence, enhance patient safety, and provide peace of mind for caregivers and families
